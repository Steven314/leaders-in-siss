# Introduction

:::: {style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%"}

"These *-isms* (and especially post-modernism) I regard as having set the discipline back, and to have severely detracted from the standing that human geography has gained as an analytical science as a result of the 'quantitative revolution'."

## What

What areas did Stimson study?

**Human Geography**

::: {style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%; font-size: 16pt"}
"During the 1970s I became more convinced that human geographers needed to work in multi-displinary teams and use rigorous quantitative methods to address challenging socio-spatial issues to develop a better 'evidence base' to inform public policy."

## Influences

- Stimson's father was involved in academic administration at the University of New England.
- He was taught geography in high school by [Mal Logan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal_Logan), a prominent geographer in Australia, leading to his interest in the field.
- Stimson's education was concurrent with the *quantitative revolution* in geography.
- He was a heavy reader of various prominent figures.
  - [Johann Heinrich von Thünen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_von_Th%C3%BCnen) - land use and rent, marginal cost
  - [Walter Christaller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Christaller) - Central Place Theory
  - [Peter Haggett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Haggett) - quantitative human geography
  - [Richard Chorley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Chorley) - Systems Theory, physical geography

# Early Career

1968 - 1983, The 'Sales and Service' Era

## Academic Work

- Stimson was involved with attracting research dollars from government and industry.
- The topics of study were
  - access to healthcare and 
  - regional impacts of new healthcare facilities.
- University of Michigan, Institute for Social Research
  - Stimson spent time developing survey methods.
  - This resulted in the formation of Centre for Applied Social and Survey Research (CASSR) at Flinders.
    - Stimson was its director for seven years.
    - CASSR surveyed healthcare, housing, entertainment, and voting behavior.

## Multi-Displinary

- Spatially *Integrated* Social Science is multi-disciplinary.
- Stimson recognized the need for combining distinct fields.

"During the 1970s I became more convinced that human geographers needed to work in multi-displinary teams and use rigorous quantitative methods to address challenging socio-spatial issues to develop a better 'evidence base' to inform public policy."

"One of the encouraging things that happened at this time was our ability to form small multi-displinary research teams..."
:::

## Regional Science Association International

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=70%}

- In reaction to the *-isms* of the 1970s, Stimson became associated with the Regional Science Association International.
- He helped form the [Australia and New Zealand section](https://www.anzrsai.org/) and is recognized as a "[Life Member](https://www.anzrsai.org/about/)" of ANZRSAI.
- Stimson was president of the section from 1980 to 1982.
- He was president of RSAI in 2005 and 2006.

# Middle Career

1983 - 1997

## Shift to Leadership Roles

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=80%}

**Australian Institue of Urban Studies (AIUS), 1983**

- Stimson left Flinders to go to the University of Canberra[^canberra], becoming Director of AIUS.
- He began to focus more on the public and business concerns of policy related to regional development.

**Head of the School of Administrative Studies, 1985**

- Stimson interacted with federal-level public policy and administration.
- He saw that there was value in spatial thinking and analysis.
- In addition to adminstrative duties, Stimson researched the effects of policy on housing and published a book.

[^canberra]: At the time it was called Canberra College of Advanced Education.

## *The Brisbane Plan*, 1990

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- The goal was a 20-year plan for developing the city of [Brisbane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane).
- The project was more oriented more toward policy and planning, so it was a shift from Stimson's home of geography and economics.
- However, Stimson was able to actually apply his theories of analytical applied geography.
- During this time Stimson moved to be the Chair of Urban Studies at Queensland University of Technology.

# Later Career

1997 - Present

## Queensland and Melbourne

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=75%}

- In 1997 Stimson took on the role of Chair in Geographical Sciences and Planning at the University of Queensland.
- He "began a substantial effort to develop a much more explicit focus on regional economic development and especially on measuring and modeling endogenous regional performance."
- Stimson was also director of and involved with a handful of groups at the University of Queensland and across Australia.
  - These groups researched homelessness, opportunity and vulnerability, and large-scale urban modeling.
- In the 2010s Stimson was involved with developing online infrastructure to better enable spatial research with the University of Melbourne.

# Conclusion

## Summary

- Although retired (as far as I can find) Stimson appears to still be writing and publishing. He is now about 81 years old.
- Diverse set of experiences between teaching, research, university and organizational leadership, public policy, and regional planning.
- Early career was more oriented toward competing for research dollars and developing survey methods.
- Later career consisted of more leadership roles while researching public policy on a wide variety of subjects.
- Greatly influenced by the quantitative revolution and prior quantitative thinkers.
- Avidly opposed to the *-isms* of 1970s and 1980s.

## Quotes

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}

::: {style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; font-size: 16pt"}

"It seems to me that a key factor is to be open to becoming engaged with researchers from other disciplinary backgrounds; to work in multi-disciplinary teams to bring to bear spatial analytic approaches to address issues of policy and business significance; and to be proactive in promulgating the potential contributions that can be made by geographers."

"Only a firm commitment in human geography programs to an applied analytical paradigm can overcome the current malaise in the discipline and re-establish it as a science."
